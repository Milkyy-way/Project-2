# Project-2
## About
The shootings in the USA have increased almost exponentially in recent years. The data that we collected has 
information about the shooting from the year 2015 until the latest week in all counties of the USA. The data 
collected from the dataset are geographical locations of shootings, armed status of the victim, flee status, weapon 
carried by the victim, name, place (county, state, city), date, race, etc. From the above-mentioned information, 
we planned on solving the answer to the questions as follows.
1) Are there bodycam recordings of the shootings?
2) How many individuals were carrying a lethal weapon?
3) How many armed people did not flee during the scene. Could they have possibly been dangerous to 
the police? Could that be one among the factors that led to the shooting?
4) What are the topmost states where shooting is common?
5) What is the age group they fall under?
6) Can the manner of death be predicted based on other variables? Does every variable influence the 
prediction made by the model?
